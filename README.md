## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to analyze the Titanic dataset using vanilla JavaScript. The code in this repository performs basic data analysis tasks on the dataset, such as reading the data and displaying the first 10 rows.

## Installation

There is no specific installation required for this project. You can simply clone the repository and open the JavaScript file in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-analysis.git
```

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Open the browser's developer console to see the output of the code.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. These files contain information about passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, gender, ticket class, survival status, and more.

The code reads the data from these CSV files using the `pandas` library in Python. However, since this project focuses on JavaScript, the code for reading the data is provided as a reference but not executed.
